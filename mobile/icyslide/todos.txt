Next Steps:
- Server:
    - Encryption and decryption
    - Check for scaling
    - Attestation aka get API Key and Signature (POC exists)
- Android App
    - Send files to server
        - For encryption
        - Decryption
        - Refactor if enough time because 
            - Decrypt and uploadFile essentially do the same
            - Check formats
    - Remove trust insecure in Manifest
    - File creation for secret
    - Signing (https://chatgpt.com/c/6713e2b9-2654-800d-8dac-13af6705f953)
    - Disable debugging
    - Obfuscation but give stripped down info
    - If possible encrypt everything and decrypt during runtime

    - Maybe skip:
        
        - Certificate Pinning

- Solution Script:
    - Fix name and content
    - Automate 



Next time:
- Sign App (todo)
- build cut down source code for challenge publishing? (todo)
- Solve script and writeup (cut down version)

Before Publishing:
- Certificate Pinning
- Adapt keys
- Signature
- URL for access to server
- Remove insecure stuff in manifest


If enough time:
    - Fix async requestsopy
    - Delete files


How to annoy:
- Root Chek lib
- Root check mine
- Signature check
- frida check
- android.os.Debug.isDebuggerConnected() || android.os.Debug.waitingForDebugger()
 if (utils.init1() || !utils.init2()) {



FINAL TODOs:
- Enabel Certificate Pinning and Test
- Change/Enable signature
    - Webserver
    - Solve
