Yesterday, this weird oil lamp-shaped USB stick was laying on the floor, so naturally I've picked it up and responsibly plugged it in. On it there was just a lonely ELF file.

Clumsy as I am, I stumbled into the ELF file and am trapped here with a Genie that calls it their home. Luckily, they granted me to write two bytes wherever to aid my grand escape. Can you help me break out?
