# Critically Acclaimed

The critically acclaimed ~~MMORPG~~ CTF challenge!

## Building

Just run `make` and distribute the produced tarfile.

## Solution

This is supposed to mimick a normal 8 person raid from Final Fantasy XIV.
For more information it's recommended to build the client and play around.

The client isn't actually fully implemented and can't talk to the server
because I ran out of time. You can just read the JSON instead.
